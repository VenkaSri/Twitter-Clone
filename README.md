# Twitter / X Clone

I began this project right after I finished school aiming to demonstrate and improve my full-stack development skills. By replicating the functionalities of Twitter / X, this clone stands as a robust platform demonstrating both the power of React in front-end development and the efficiency of Spring Boot in handling back-end operations. I've deployed an initial version of the application, embodying my admiration for CI/CD practices. So I will be actively making regular updates and enhancements, and perhaps most importantly, refining and fixing the codebase as I continue to learn and grow in my development journey.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Spring Boot
- Tailwind CSS
- Jenkins
- Amazon Web Services

## Getting Started

To get this full-stack application up and running, you'll need to set up both the frontend and the backend. Each part of the application has its own set of instructions:
Frontend Setup

    Navigate to the twitter-clone-front-end directory.
    Follow the instructions in the README.md file located within this directory to set up the frontend part of the application.

Backend Setup

    Navigate to the twitter-clone-back-end directory.
    Follow the instructions in the README.md file located within this directory to set up the backend part of the application.

By following the setup instructions in each directory, you'll be able to get the entire application running smoothly.

### GitHub Project Tracking

To provide transparency and real-time updates on the development process, I've set up a GitHub Project. You can view the project board to see what's currently being worked on, what's up next, and what has been recently completed.
